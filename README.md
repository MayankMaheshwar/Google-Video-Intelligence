# Google-Video-Intelligence


Google Cloud Video Intelligence makes videos searchable and discoverable by extracting metadata with an easy to use REST API. You can now search every moment of every video file in your catalog. It quickly annotates videos stored in Cloud Storage, and helps you identify key entities (nouns) within your video; and when they occur within the video. Separate signal from noise by retrieving relevant information within the entire video, shot-by-shot, -or per frame.
