Run this command to create a JSON request file with the following text, and save it as request.json :

cat > request.json <<EOF
{
   "inputUri":"gs://spls/gsp154/video/train.mp4",
   "features": [
       "LABEL_DETECTION"
   ]
}
EOF

To make the process simpler, a public video of a train available to your qwiklabs project is used as the value for your inputUri. If preferred or running in a personal project, any video can be used in place by uploading it to Cloud Storage and providing its Cloud Storage URI (format: gs://bucket/object) for the value of "inputUri".

Use curl to make a videos:annotate request passing the filename of the entity request:

curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$(gcloud auth print-access-token)'' \
    'https://videointelligence.googleapis.com/v1/videos:annotate' \
    -d @request.json


The Video Intelligence API creates an operation to process your request. You should now see a response that includes your operation name, which should look similar to this one:

{
  "name": "projects/474887704060/locations/asia-east1/operations/16366331060670521152"
}



You'll now see information related to your operation. If the operation has completed, a done field is included and set to true:

{
  "name": "projects/425437283751/locations/asia-east1/operations/17938636079131796601",
  "metadata": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.videointelligence.v1.Annota
tionProgressMetadata",
    "progressMetadata": [
      {
        "inputUri": "gs://spls/gsp154/video/train.mp4",
        "startTime": "2016-09-22T21:41:56.766091Z",
        "lastUpdateTime": "2016-09-22T21:42:03.889743Z"
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
}
After giving the request some time (about a minute, typically), re-run the command and the same request returns annotated results:

{
  "name": "projects/425437283751/locations/asia-east1/operations/17938636079131796601",
  "metadata": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.videointelligence.v1.AnnotateVideoProgress",
    "annotationProgress": [
      {
        "inputUri": "/spls/gsp154/video/train.mp4",
        "progressPercent": 100,
        "startTime": "2017-02-17T22:39:00.333942Z",
        "updateTime": "2017-02-17T22:39:11.414399Z"
      }
    ]
  },
  "done": true,
  "response": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.videointelligence.v1.AnnotateVideoResponse",
    "annotationResults": [
      {
        "inputUri": "/spls/gsp154/video/train.mp4",
        "segmentLabelAnnotations": [
          {
            "entity": {
              "entityId": "/m/01yrx",
              "languageCode": "en-US"
            },
            "segments": [
              {
                "segment": {
                  "startTimeOffset": "0s",
                  "endTimeOffset": "14.833664s"
                },
                "confidence": 0.98509187
              }
            ]
          },
         ...
